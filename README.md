#Whiskey Drop  Number 1
##Bootstrap 4

A very interesting set of lessons all about how to work with bootstrap and the
many ways it can be useful for building a website.
Bootstrap, customizing with bespoke designs will to help your site stand out
from the rest.

In all these lessons, we were shown how to build a website from conception 
and also how to design a dropdown menu. All with Bootstrap and finally cleaning 
up the remaining content on the landing page. 

I have enjoyed these lessons and I am looking forward to moving on to the next
module Bootstrap deprecated.
